# Hello Hackers

## Command History
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wdBgtxlR83LLy9nbFZX6_Awb2Va.0lNzEzNxwCM4kjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ the flag is pwn.college{wdBgtxlR83LLy9nbFZX6_Awb2Va.0lNzEzNxwCM4kjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt that the shell saves previously executed commands and that i can use/ view those commands again by toggling the up and down arrows to retrieve them.
